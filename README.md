# ecdf

Visualize pandas [**d**ata**f**rames](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) with [**ec**harts](http://echarts.baidu.com/).



Note:

* It is designed to visualize dataframe in wide format, e.g. every column of a dataframe is a series in a echart.

*  Still in very early experimental stage, everything may change.
